Android Studio, Java, usage: SharedPreferences interface, lifecycle and basic functions and methods. 
As part of the Mobile Devices Programming course at the State University of Rio de Janeiro, I developed a simple Android application. 
Overall, this project allowed me to apply the concepts learned in the course, such as activity lifecycle, data persistence, and user interface design, 
in a practical and hands-on way.
